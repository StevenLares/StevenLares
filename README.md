# GitHub vs Codeberg:

## GitHub:
I use this GitHub account to collaborate on mainstream opensource projects / non-libre software, to provide a simple portfolio, and to store some backups in private repos.

## Codeberg:
I use Codeberg to host mostly libre projects, which I create during my spare time. 
Some of these projects result from my blog, Reclaimyour.tech
In the future, I may migrate all of my public repos from Github to Codeberg.

Public repos created for or from my blog, Reclaimyour.tech:
https://codeberg.org/Reclaim-Your-Tech

Public repos on my Codeberg account:
