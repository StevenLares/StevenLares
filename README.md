# GitHub vs Codeberg Usage:

## GitHub:
I use this GitHub account to collaborate on mainstream opensource projects / non-libre software, to provide a simple portfolio, and to store some backups in private repos.

## Codeberg:
I use Codeberg to host mostly libre projects, which I create during my spare time. 
Some of them result from my blog, Reclaimyour.tech, which I have set as an organization on that platform.
